# Drop impact onto viscous pools

Code to simulation the impact of a droplet onto a deep pool of another fluid using the [Basilisk](http://basilisk.fr/) flow solver.

## Installation

-Uses a standard [installation](http://basilisk.fr/src/INSTALL) of Basilisk with the extra visualisation [packages](http://basilisk.fr/src/gl/INSTALL) required to produce video outputs.

-The three-phase method of [Chizari](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/chizari/threephase/) is included here to allow independent variation of the droplet, pool and surrounding air fluids including interfacial tensions.

-[gfsview](http://gfs.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) can also be installed in order to view the outputed simulation slices.
